# Earthquakes in the Andes
Students from the Roux Institute DS5010 course temporarily collaborated on analyzing earthquake data through USGS API requests back in early 2024. This project involved completing and polishing the unfinished work, then creating a GitHub pages site to display the earthquake data near the South American West Coast. The data should provide visual evidence of the pacific plate subducting under the Andes.
