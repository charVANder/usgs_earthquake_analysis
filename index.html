    <p>Earthquakes are a result of volcanic activity and movements occurring within the earth's crust. In particular, major earthquakes are often
      confined to particularly active regions in the world, corresponding to the edges of tectonic plates which brush up against
      each other and release tension in the form of tremors and quakes. One of these active regions is the Andes region along the
      western coast of South America. As shown in the image below, the Andes region is located right along the edges of the Nazca and
      South American tectonic plates, making it a hot spot for seismic activity.</p>

    </div>
    <p>The collision between the oceanic Nazca plate and the continental South American plate is also said to have given rise to the formation of the Andes!

    <p>By gathering and analyzing earthquake data from the United States Geological Survey, we are able to observe the seismic activity
      occurring in the Andes region. This includes data such as the earthquake magnitudes, depths of the tremors, and the coordinates and times of each earthquake.
      More specifically, by using this data, we are able to provide visual evidence of tectonic plate subduction in the Andes region--a
      likely cause to the numerous earthquakes that occur in that region every year. You can view our findings in the section below!</p>

        <p>This animation displays all the earthquakes recorded over time in the Andes region from 1/31/2023 to 1/31/2024. The depths of each
          earthquake are shown with the color bar on the side. As you can see, as time goes on, the earthquakes move increasingly inland while
          simultaneously increasing in depth. This suggests that the earthquakes are consistently generated by the subduction of the Nazca plate
          under the South American plate.</p>

        <p>The image below is a static visualization of the animation, providing a snapshot of all earthquakes in the region during the same time period.
          As one might expect, the clustered distribution of earthquakes appears along delineated lines around the edges of the tectonic plates.
          Similar patterns can also be found in other parts of the world. The shallowest earthquakes in the Andes occur about 100-200km deep near the coast,
          while the deepest earthquake occurs near Bolivia around 600km deep.</p>

        <p>This is the corresponding scatterplot of the depths and magnitudes of all the USGS recorded earthquakes from the Andes Region in a year.
          For the most part, the magnitudes of the earthquakes remain relatively constant regardless of the depth.
          The magnitudes mostly range from 4.0 to 5.0 with the exception of a few outliers. Similarly, the depths mostly range from 100-300km deep.
          All in all, based purely on depths and magnitudes, the earthquakes that occurred in the Andes over the year appear fairly consistent with
          the exception of a few outliers. Had this not been the case, there might have been a need for an in-depth study with regards to public safety. 
          For example, a sporadic influx of unusually high-magnitude earthquakes might suggest a concern for a major earthquake occurring in the future.</p>

      <p>Analyzing the earthquake data in the Andes region reveals insights into tectonic plate interactions and seismic activity,
        illustrating the nature and evolution of the earthquakes over time. The animation, static image, and scatter plot highlight the inland movement
        and increasing depth of seismic events over time, indicating tectonic plate subduction. Furthermore, the consistent patterns of earthquake
        magnitudes and depths imply a stable seismic behavior in that region. This can be essential when evaluating potential risks with regards
        to public safety. For example, identifying abnormal activity from the region's normally stable state could provide preemptive warnings
        for major earthquakes. The region can then better prepare their communities and/or infrastructure for those risks and minimize impact.</p>
      <p>One of the benefits of these studies is that they can offer reproducible insights in other seismically active regions worldwide.
        Moreover, a deeper analysis of the earthquake data would enhance our understanding of seismic behavior, improving earthquake prediction
        and mitigation strategies. Additional analyses for this study in the future might include:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><u>Analyzing other regions</u> - comparing information between different high-risk areas to reveal new patterns that improve earthquake detection accuracy.</li>
          <li><u>Adding additional geospatial datasets (topography, fault lines, etc.)</u> - overlaying datasets in a GIS (Geographic Information Systems) environment to
            provide a more comprehensive understanding.</li>
          <li><u>Enhanced depth analysis</u> - further analyzing earthquake depth distributions to better understand the interactions within the earth's crust.</li>
          <li><u>Enhanced time analysis</u> - expanding upon the data by analyzing longer periods of time, historical patterns, seasons, etc.</li>
          <li><u>Integrating machine learning</u> - utilizing complex algorithms on larger datasets to aid with earthquake detection.</li>
